== Synopsis
  An easy way to implement the facade pattern in your classes. In short,
  this library wraps singleton methods from another class as instance
  methods of the current class.

== Installation
  gem install facade
   
== Usage
  require 'facade'

  class MyString < String
    extend Facade
    facade File, :dirname, :basename
  end

  f = MyString.new('/home/djberge')
  puts f.basename # 'djberge'
  puts f.dirname  # '/home'
