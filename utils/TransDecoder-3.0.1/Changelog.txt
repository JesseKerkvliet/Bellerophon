## 2016-03-11 v2.1 release
-added cpu parameter to TransDecoder.predict
-retaining gene identifier information from cufflinks output
-added sample data and examples for the various use-cases.





## 2015-01-26   v2.0 release

-overhauled the build
    -removed the active searching of Pfam and all MPI-related funcitonality
    -runs in 2 phase:
        -TransDecoder.LongOrfs : extracs the long ORFs
        -TransDecoder.Predict : predicts the likely coding regions among the ORFs
            -step can use Pfam and blastp search results (blast support is a new addition)
    -run Pfam and/or BlastP searches directly or try using "HPC GridRunner" (http://HpcGridRunner.github.io)

-moved to github 



## 2014-07-04

-added 'make simple' to build just the essential components involving parafly and cdhit
-removed the 'cds.' prefix from the pep and cds sequence accessions.
